# FoodExpress - Food Delivery Website 🍔🚀

**FoodExpress** is a responsive, frontend-only web application designed for a seamless food delivery experience. This capstone project demonstrates modern UI/UX principles using pure HTML and CSS, featuring a clean design system with a vibrant orange and white color palette.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project serves as a prototype for a food delivery platform. It includes essential user flows such as user authentication (Login/Signup), browsing a food menu, and managing a shopping cart. The interface is designed to be intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing across different device sizes.

## ✨ Features

* **User Authentication**:
    * **Login Page**: Secure-looking login interface with email/password validation fields.
    * **Sign Up Page**: Registration form with fields for full name, email, and password confirmation.
    * *Navigation*: Seamless linking between "Sign Up" and "Login" for smooth user experience.
* **Main Dashboard**:
    * A welcoming landing page (`MainPage.html`) that serves as the central hub for the application.
* **Food Menu**:
    * A dedicated `menu.html` page displaying various food categories and items available for order.
* **Shopping Cart**:
    * `AddToCart.html` feature allowing users to review their selected items before checkout.
* **Responsive Design**:
    * Fully responsive layouts that adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens (using Media Queries).
    * Custom CSS variables and flexbox/grid layouts for consistent alignment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure for better accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3**: Custom styling including animations, transitions, and responsive design (no external CSS frameworks used).
